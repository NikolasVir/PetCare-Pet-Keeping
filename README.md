# PetCare-Pet-Keeping

This is a Pet Keeping management system for Pet Owners and Pet Keepers for cource CS359-Web Programming. More details can be found in the "project_details.pdf" file (Greek).
Important: the Data Base and some basic functions were created from the course instructor, but I made additional functions that interact with it.

Requirements:
1. Xampp installed
2. TomCat installed and configured
3. Import Project and resolve Jettison Library location
4. If a database does not exists create one with DataBase Creator
   

Notes: 
1. No Bonus was implemented.
2. ChatGPT does not work because of "Exceeded Limit Quota" error
3. Delete User as Admin does not work.
4. Changing acxount details does not work for both types of users: PetKeepers and PetOwners.
