PetCare-Pet-Keeping
Welcome to PetCare-Pet-Keeping, a comprehensive management system designed for Pet Owners and Pet Keepers. This project is part of the CS359-Web Programming course. For a detailed overview, please refer to the “project_details.pdf” file available in Greek.

Important: The database and some fundamental functions were initially created by the course instructor. I have contributed additional functionalities that enhance interaction with the existing system.

Requirements
To ensure the proper functioning of the PetCare-Pet-Keeping system, please adhere to the following requirements:

XAMPP: Ensure XAMPP is installed on your system.
TomCat: TomCat must be installed and correctly configured.
Project Import: Import the project into your IDE and resolve the Jettison Library location.
Database Creation: If a database does not exist, create one using the DataBase Creator (interact with the website after setting up XAMPP and TomCat).
Notes
No bonus features were implemented in this version.
The ChatGPT functionality is currently unavailable due to an “Exceeded Limit Quota” error.
The ‘Delete User’ feature for Admins is non-functional.
Modifying account details is not operational for both user types: PetKeepers and PetOwners.
For older versions of Java, it is necessary to import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet instead of javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.
